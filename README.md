# PlayDo Frontend

## Directory
Note: This app is under the `playdo-frontend/` directory of the playdo project, all commands must be run from this
directory.

## Tech Stack
Started from a template: https://github.com/joaopaulomoraes/reactjs-vite-tailwindcss-boilerplate

Built with Vite, React 18, TypeScript, Vitest, Testing Library, TailwindCSS 3, Eslint and Prettier

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev)
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io)

## Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Types**: Strongly typed data structures used throughout the application
- **API Services**: Functions for interacting with backend APIs
- **Components**: Reusable UI components for rendering the application

Key components:
- `App`: Main application component, manages conversation selection state
- `ConversationView`: Displays messages from the selected conversation
- `Message`: Renders individual messages with appropriate styling

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm 10 or higher (idk, that's what I have)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with hot reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

### Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

View and interact with tests via UI:
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### Linting and Type Checking

Check for linting issues:
```bash
npm run lint
```

Check for TypeScript errors:
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

## Important Notes for Development

- The application uses the React hooks pattern extensively (useState, useEffect)
- Components are designed to be stateless where possible, with state management handled by parent components
- Error states, loading states, and empty states are handled for all data fetching
- TailwindCSS is used for styling - refer to the TailwindCSS documentation for class names
