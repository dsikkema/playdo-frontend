       * Note: replaces the html content implementation of the real ConversationSelector, because we don't need or care about those implementation
       * details. We only need something in the test component so that we can hook into it and cause the 'onSelectConversation' callback to be
       * called. This is because of the way that the parent and child components interrelate to one another - the child can run the parent's
       * code by means of callbacks.
       *
       * For instance, in one of the tests below, we see:
       * ```
       *     await user.click(screen.getByTestId('select-conversation-button'))
       * ```
       * Which is the test's way of causing the child to run the callback, by clicking the button that's wired up to the callback.
       *
       * The key idea is this test only cares about the way in which the parent interacts with the children, not on the internal
       * workings of the children.
