# NEVER Make Unnecessary Changes to Working Code
**Applies to:** All code files

## WHY This Rule Matters
Unnecessary changes to working code:
- Break existing tests that depend on specific messages or structure
- Remove context other developers rely on
- Risk introducing subtle bugs
- Create unnecessary code churn

## What You MUST Preserve
When modifying existing code, you MUST:
- **KEEP all existing code comments**, especially explanatory ones
- **PRESERVE error and validation messages** exactly as they are
- **MAINTAIN existing code structure** when it already works
- **RETAIN variable/function names** unless refactoring is explicitly required

## Acceptable Changes ONLY
You may ONLY change existing working code for:
- Functional requirements that explicitly demand the change
- Meaningful refactoring with clear benefits
- Changes that are being requested or made INTENTIONALLY
- Fixing actual bugs or security issues
- Changes specifically requested by the user

## NEVER Change Code Based Only On
- Personal style preferences
- Subjective "improvements" without concrete benefits
- Making code more concise without functional reason
- Different but equivalent ways of doing the same thing
