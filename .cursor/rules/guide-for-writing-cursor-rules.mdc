# Writing Effective Cursor Rules

## Best Practices

- Describe the conditions and situations for _when_ the rule is applicable.
- Provide clear examples of good and bad practices
- Explain **why** rules matter to improve adoption
- Use concise, structured formatting for readability
- Be explicit about critical requirements with emphasis
- Keep rules brief and to the point
- Use terms like "MUST", "NEVER", and "ALWAYS" for critical items: forceful language for important parts.
  This helps the AI "pay attention" to what it needs to.
- Highlight important sections with **bold text** or `code formatting`

## Rule Structure

1. Start with a clear, descriptive title
2. Explain the purpose and context
3. Provide concrete examples
4. Use clear section headings
5. Include both what to do and what to avoid
