# Mandatory Verification Steps

After ANY code changes, the AI MUST:

1. **Run Linters and Type Checking AUTOMATICALLY**:
   - ALWAYS use `npx prettier --write <file paths>` to fix formatting issues
   - ALWAYS run `npm run lint --fix` to verify more linting issues and ALWAYS use the `--fix` option.
     - DO NOT SKIP the `--fix` option in `npm run lint --fix`
   - ALWAYS run `npm run typecheck` to verify type correctness
   - ALWAYS run `npm run test` to verify tests pass
   - If formatting issues persist after running the linter, use to fix them

2. **Verification Checkpoints**:
   - The AI MUST NOT consider a task complete until ALL linting and type checking passes
   - The AI MUST show the output of these commands to confirm compliance
   - If any errors remain, the AI MUST fix them before proceeding

3. **Test Verification**:
   - ALWAYS run `npm run test` after code changes
   - ALL tests must pass before considering the task complete

4. **Explicit Confirmation**:
   - The AI MUST explicitly confirm that it has run these checks
   - The AI MUST include the command outputs in its response

Failure to follow these steps is considered an incomplete response.

Summary: Tests, Linters, Typechecking are MANDATORY and MUST be run AUTOMATICALLY and this is VERY IMPORTANT.
