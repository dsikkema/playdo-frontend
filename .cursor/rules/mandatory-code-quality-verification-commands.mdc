# Mandatory Verification Steps

After ANY code changes, the AI MUST:

1. **Run Tests First**:
   - ALWAYS run `npm run test` to verify tests pass - do this first.

2. **Run Linters and Type Checking AUTOMATICALLY**:
   - ALWAYS run `npm run typecheck` to verify type correctness - do this BEFORE linters.
   - ALWAYS use `npm run prettier` to fix formatting issues (this command updates files to fix them)
    - Do this BEFORE running lint
   - ALWAYS run `npm run lint` to verify good formatting (this may also write updates to fix them).

3. **Verification Checkpoints**:
   - The AI MUST NOT consider a task complete until ALL linting and type checking passes
   - The AI MUST show the output of these commands to confirm compliance
   - If any errors remain, the AI MUST fix them before proceeding

4. **Test Verification**:
   - ALWAYS run `npm run test` after code changes
   - ALL tests must pass before considering the task complete

5. **Explicit Confirmation**:
   - The AI MUST explicitly confirm that it has run these checks
   - The AI MUST include the command outputs in its response

Failure to follow these steps is considered an incomplete response.

Summary: Tests, Linters, Typechecking are MANDATORY and MUST be run AUTOMATICALLY and this is VERY IMPORTANT.
