# IF there is a bug that the user is telling you about then do this:

- Think out loud about why existing tests did not ALREADY prevent the bug from being introduced. Existing tests SHOULD HAVE
  caught the bug and SHOULD fail because of it.
- Write a new test case that exercises the condition necessary to surface the bug. START with the failing test and then
  try to fix the code, and then the test you wrote should pass.

  As an important reminder: WRITE TESTS to surface the bug BEFORE writing a fix. If this test is skipped, there's a possibility
  that the test you write afterwards could be unwittingly tailored to the fix-implementation and not actually fix the bug.
