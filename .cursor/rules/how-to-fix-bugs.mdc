# Bug Fixing Workflow

When addressing a bug:

1. **Analyze Existing Tests**
   - Consider why existing tests didn't catch the bug
   - Review what test cases should have prevented the issue

2. **Create a Failing Test First**
   - Write a test that reproduces the bug
   - Run the test to confirm it fails due to the bug
   - This test should pass once the fix is implemented

3. **Fix the Code**
   - Only after creating a failing test, fix the application code
   - Run the test to verify your fix works

> **IMPORTANT**: It is MANDATORY to write tests BEFORE fixing the bug. This prevents creating tests that are tailored to your specific implementation rather than the correct behavior.
