# Linters and type checking

If you changed any TypeScrpt/React code, ALWAYS:
[ ] Run type checking: `npm run typecheck`
[ ] Run linter: `npm run lint --fix` (Note: PLEASE DO use `--fix` so it automatically fixes issues when possible)
[ ] Format code: `npm run format` (if available) or use editor's format command
[ ] As mentioned by other rules, still also run tests: `npm run test`

DO NOT commit code that has type errors or linting issues. Fix ALL errors and warnings before committing.
